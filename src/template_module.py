'''helper module for project _____
   
This is an extended summary that one can use, if necessary.
This module demonstrates documentation as specified by the `NumPy 
Documentation HOWTO`_. Docstrings may extend over multiple lines. Sections
are created with a section header followed by an underline of equal length:

Variables
---------
list of variables with short description (not necessary if number of variables <20)
sections support any reStructuredText formatting, including
literal blocks::

    $ python example_numpy.py


Section breaks are created with two blank lines. Section breaks are also
implicitly created anytime a new section starts. Section bodies *may* be
indented:

Functions
---------
    list of functions with short description (not necessary if number of functions <10)
    This is an example of an indented section. It's like any other section,
    but the body is indented to help it stand out from surrounding text.

If a section is indented, then a section break is created by
resuming unindented text.

Classes
-------
    list of Classes with short description (not necessary if number of classes <10)
Notes
-----
    any remarks that do not fit anywhere else
References
----------
    list of books, references to momentum, to articles, ....

The docstring may span multiple lines. The type may optionally be specified

def my_function_name(filename, dtype, iterable, shape, files, copy=False, *args, **kwargs):
    '''Short description of what the function does
    
    If necessary (if the function is longer than 15 lines), here we can have a longer description of what the 
    function does.
    Function parameters should be documented in the ``Parameters`` section.
    The name of each parameter is required. The type and description of each
    parameter is optional, but should be included if not obvious.

    If \*args or \*\*kwargs are accepted,
    they should be listed as ``*args`` and ``**kwargs``.

    The format for a parameter is::

        name : type
            description

            The description may span multiple lines. Following lines
            should be indented to match the first line of the description.
            The ": type" is optional.

            Multiple paragraphs are supported in parameter
            descriptions.
            
    Parameters
    ----------
    filename : str
        description on what filename is
    dtype : data-type
        description of what dtype is
    iterable: iterable
        description
    shape : int or tuple of int
        description
    files : list of str
        description of what files are
    copy : bool, optional
        description on what copy is
    *args
        Variable length argument list.
    **kwargs
        Arbitrary keyword arguments.

    Raises
    ------
    RuntimeError
        description of RuntimeError
        The ``Raises`` section is a list of all exceptions
        that are relevant to the interface.

    Returns
    -------
    str
        Explanation of what the type of the returned value is
        The return type is not optional. The ``Returns`` section may span
        multiple lines and paragraphs. Following lines should be indented to
        match the first line of the description.

        The ``Returns`` section supports any reStructuredText formatting,
        including literal blocks::

            {
                'param1': param1,
                'param2': param2

    in an ``Attributes`` section and follow the same formatting as a
    function's ``Args`` section. Alternatively, attributes may be documented
    inline with the attribute's declaration (see __init__ method below).

    Properties created with the ``@property`` decorator should be documented
    in the property's getter method.

        Either form is acceptable, but the two should not be mixed. Choose one
        convention to document the __init__ method and be consistent with it.
